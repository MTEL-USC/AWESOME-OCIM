# *A Working Environment for Simulating Ocean Movement and Elemental Cycling in an Ocean Circulation Inverse Model framework*

This code runs the AWESOME OCIM model.
A publication is in prep.
Please contact Professor Seth John at the University of Southern California (<sethjohn@usc.edu>) or graduate student Hengdi Liang (<hengdili@usc.edu>) for more information.

This repository contains the MATLAB code but no data.
A full version of the model is available on [our lab website](http://www.mtel.rocks/mtel/awesomeOCIM.html), along with more information about the model.

## Usage

There are two ways to run the model:
  - Run `SetupSingle.m` and change parameters in the `do` structure
  - Run `launchGUI.m` to launch a graphical user interface to set model inputs and plot composite profiles/sections from GEOTRACES data or model outputs.
