# AWESOME-OCIM-v1.1
# A Working Environment for Simulating Ocean Movement and Elemental cycling in an Ocean Circulation Inverse Model framework.
# This code runs the AWESOME OCIM model. A publication is in prep. Please contact Professor Seth John at the University of Southern California (sethjohn@usc.edu) or graduate student Hengdi Liang (hengdili@usc.edu) for more information.
# In GitHub we have uploaded the codes but no GEOTRACES data. A full version of the model is available at our lab website http://www.mtel.rocks/mtel/awesomeOCIM.html, along with more information about the model.
# There are two ways to run the model: 1. Run SetupSingle.m and change parameters in the do structure; 2. Run launchGUI.m to launch a graphical user interface to set model inputs and plot composite profiles/sections from GEOTRACES data or model outputs.
